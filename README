# DVD-Audio Track Extraction Tools

Tools to extract the high-rate MLP or LPCM-encoded tracks
from unencrypted DVD-A .AOB files.

## Description

*extract_tracks* will read an ATS_*.IFO, parse out the
tracks in each title, locate these tracks in the relevant
AOB file, and copy these out into separate MPEG files. The
MPEGs should contain a single private stream, either LPCM
or MLP, which can be converted and downmixed as needed.
The UDF file offset map is required, as track locations
are specified as sector offsets on disc.

*offsets* will examine the AUDIO_TS/ folder of a DVD-A
and write out a binary file containing the offset and
file size (in DVD sectors) of each file therein. Requires
the disc to be present and mounted.

## Requirements

* libdvdread, for defines and the UDF* functions
* POSIX OS, but porting should not be difficult
